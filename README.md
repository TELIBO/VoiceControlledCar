# Arduino Voice-Controlled Car

This project implements a voice-controlled car using an Arduino board and a Voice Recognition Module.

## Description
Description of the proposed Idea: 
The central idea is to harness voice recognition technology to facilitate a more inclusive and engaging play experience for small children and empower disabled patients lacking lower limb mobility. For children, the project aims to eliminate the dependence on electronic devices, allowing them to interact with toys through intuitive voice commands. Simultaneously, for disabled individuals, the technology can be adapted to motorized wheelchairs, offering an independent and dignified means of movement without requiring assistance.

Problem Statement:
In a world increasingly dominated by electronic devices, it becomes crucial to provide alternatives that cater to the needs of specific user groups, particularly children and differently-abled individuals. The challenge lies in developing a hands-free, intuitive control system that allows small children to interact with toys without relying on electronic gadgets such as phones or laptops. Simultaneously, this system should serve as a practical solution for disabled patients without lower limb mobility, empowering them to move around effortlessly in their wheelchairs without external assistance. The objective is to bridge the gap between traditional play and mobility aids, fostering inclusivity and accessibility through the integration of voice-controlled technology.
