# Arduino Voice-Controlled Car

This project implements a voice-controlled car using an Arduino board and a Voice Recognition Module.

## Description

The Arduino code provided allows you to control the movements of a car using voice commands recognized by the Voice Recognition Module. The car can be instructed to move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, or stop.

## Components Used

- Arduino board
- Voice Recognition Module
- Motor drivers (if applicable)
- Motors and wheels

## Setup

1. Connect the Voice Recognition Module to the Arduino board according to the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the `voice_controlled_car.ino` sketch to the Arduino board.
3. Power on the Arduino board and Voice Recognition Module.
4. Speak voice commands (e.g., "forward", "left", "stop") to control the car.
